### Description
This is a project is an individual in-course assignment (ICA) that assess:
- Personal and Transferable Skills Development
- Research, Knowledge and Cognitive Skills
- Professional Skills

### Module
This project was completed in R and the goal was to predict Accident Severity (Traffic Delay) with variables under:
- Traffic Attributes (11 variables)
- Address Attributes (7 variables)
- Weather Attributes (11 variables)
- Point-of-Interest Attributes (13 variables)
- Period of Day (4 variables)

#### Actions
1. Data Cleaning and preprocessing
2. Data Visualization
3. Data Modelling (K-Nearest Neigbour, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier)
4. Model Optimization
5. Model Performance Evaluation
